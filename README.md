I am Camilo, a Linux user, having used the system as my daily driver for both personal and work-
related issues since 2005.
Thru Linux, I ended up meeting, and later falling in love with, the Software Development area. 
I program in Python but have no particular love for the language since what attracts me to this
software developing area is the process itself, regardless of the programming language used. That
being said, I already programmed in Rust and C++, though I don’t consider myself, at this moment,
proficient in C++. I have an interest in other programming languages.
I’m also a Rust enthusiast and enjoy very much programming with this language. As with
blockchain, I think Rust will have a powerful changing positive effect in various fields.
I’ve been a blockchain enthusiast and early adopter since 2010. I firmly believe this technology is
and will continue to be changing the world for the better. I desire to work in this awesome field of
IT.
